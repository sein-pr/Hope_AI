            "Uranium is a silvery-white metallic chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is naturally radioactive and is the primary fuel for nuclear power plants. Its unique nuclear properties make it suitable for energy production through nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.",
            "Found in small amounts in rocks, soil, and water, uranium is a relatively common element in the Earth's crust, more abundant than silver or gold. It's an important energy source due to its high energy density."

The solution dissolves the uranium, and the uranium-rich solution is then pumped to the surface for processing. ISR significantly minimizes surface disruption, reduces solid waste generation, and lowers energy consumption compared to conventional mining. It's particularly suitable for permeable sandstone-hosted deposits. [cite: 54]",

Certain bacteria accelerate the leaching process, making the extraction more efficient and reducing the need for harsh chemicals. This approach is gaining traction for its lower environmental impact and potential for recovering uranium from previously uneconomical deposits. [cite: 54]"
